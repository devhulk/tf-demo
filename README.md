# TFE and TFC Demos

Goal of this repository is to combine multiple demos into one area that takes a customer through the adoption journey of Terraform Enterprise and Terraform Cloud.

## Current Directories

```azure-demo/```

Creates a simple VM in azure with all the appropriate resources.

Here's a link to the [Azure Terraform Provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html) for reference.

```azure-module/```

Takes azure-demo resources and combines them in a module that is consumable by other parts of your IT Infrastructure.

Check out the [Terraform Module Documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/index.html) for further info on how to create your own modules.
