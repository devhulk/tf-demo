# Azure Module

In this example we are going to illustrate making it simple for a team to consume and create a VM. The example is a be arbitrary but the point is to emphasize how Teams can simplify how their developers consume and create infrastructure using Terraform.

We will be going from ```azure-demo/``` to a very simplified version where a developer would only need to supply a few parameters vs creating multiple resources.
